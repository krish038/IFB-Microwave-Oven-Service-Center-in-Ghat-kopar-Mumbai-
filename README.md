The microwave uses radiation which is absorbed by water sugars and supports this absorption; it excites these molecules into atomic motion. When it doesn't function properly, or parts are damaged, it needs proper maintenance. Severe damages also occur which we cannot restrict. Our well-trained technician’s area unit was repaired to the doorstep service. We do service for 24/7. Which we take an inexpensive and cheap price of 350/-. We’ll provide you with valuable and worthwhile full services in Mumbai. https://ifbservicecentermumbai.co.in/ifb-microwave-oven-service-center-in-ghat-kopar-mumbai/
